# CannonDefense
A tower defense game, where you have to place towers that shoot cannonballs to protect your self from bigger enemy cannon balls the game gets exponantially larger.
I have plans to add extras eventually, but as i scaled the project the code became less and less readable so i dont know if im gonna implement the full list.

The list:
-optimization
-bosses
-a new type of tower
-different types of enemeies with different speeds and healthpoints
-a main menu

the libraries i used are:
pygame and math

Made with python pygame.
